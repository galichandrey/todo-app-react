Improvements:

* Each task has a timer that we can start and stop.
When you press "Start" button the timer begins to count down the time and is updated every second.
When timer stopped, the countdown stops and it can be resumed by pressing the "Start" button.

* The timer works correctly when changing browser tabs and changing application tabs (All, Active, Completed).
